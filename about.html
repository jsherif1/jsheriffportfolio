            <h2>John Sheriff</h2>
            <p>
              I'm John! I'm currently wrapping up my senior year at ASU,
              majoring in GIT Full Stack. My graduation can't come soon enough
              this December! Life is pretty full these days. I'm a husband and
              father to an amazing 15-month-old little girl, and we've even
              started dabbling in farming out here in western NY. To keep the
              lights on (and fund my coffee addiction!), I work as a manager at
              a well-known coffee chain. My path to web development has been
              anything but typical. Before diving into the world of code, I
              served 8 years in the Army Infantry. It was an intense experience
              that taught me a lot about discipline, teamwork, and seeing things
              through. I'm also a proud member of the Cheyenne River Sioux
              tribe, and my heritage is a huge influence on how I approach
              design. I believe everyone deserves access to technology, and I'm
              passionate about creating websites that are both inclusive and
              user-friendly.

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Beyond the professional stuff, there are a few other things that
              make me, well, me. I was adopted when I was 8, and recently
              reconnected with my birth family - it's been an incredible
              journey. When I'm not chasing after my daughter, you can usually
              find me with my headphones on, camera in hand, or controller in
              front of the screen. Music, photography, and video games are my
              go-to ways to unwind.
